## Lesson Learning Objectives


### Learning Objectives
After following this lesson, learners will be able to:

we make all these objectives measureable with hands-on exercises during workshop. 
 
* Learn how to read specific geophysics data formats (SEG-Y data).this is the first step, therefore, we definitely reach this during the workshop. **verbaction/specific/time-bound/measurable/attainable**
* Basic visualiztion (Matplotlib) and the interpretation of time, depth, and contrast of raw SEG-Y data.**verbaction/specific/time-bound/attainable**
* Understand and apply pre-processing filters (mean, median, automatic gain control) in the **time domain**, including fundamental theory for the aformetnioned filters.**verbaction/specific/time-bound/measurable/attainable**
* Understand and apply pre-processing filters (band-pass, notch) in the **frequency domain**, including fundamental theory for the aformetnioned filters.**verbaction/specific/time-bound/measurable/attainable** Interpret processed images through simple filters.**verbaction/time-bound/measurable**
* Explore advanced filtering (deconvolution, migration) techniques and their applications.
* Group project on exploring to find other filters that are applicable to this type of images.**specific/attaible** 
* how to work with advanced Python libraries for reading and exporting data.
