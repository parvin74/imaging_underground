This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

## Target Audience

Group 1: Civil engineers, geologists, geophysicists, petrophysics, earth sciences.
Group 2: Medical imaging students 

### Prerequisite Knowledge for Attendees

Attendees must have basic knowledge of porous media and dense materials.

Medical Students: Understand the difference in density between tissues and bones, which is crucial for interpreting medical imaging (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) and diagnosing conditions.

Earth Sciences Students: Be familiar with the density and strength variations in Earth's layers, essential for studying geological processes, earthquake behavior, and resource exploration.

*FIXME add any relevant information about how and why you chose this target audience. 
Information like this can be helpful for future collaborators/contributors/users to understand the scope of your lesson.*

### Prerequisite skills
- Basic Python programming
    1. Understanding of Python syntax and structure (e.g., loops, functions, variables).
    2. Ability to write and execute simple Python scripts.
- Working with Python Libraries
    1. numpy, matplotlib.
- Porous material
    1. knowing the nature of non-solid material such as rocks and human-body as two exmaples.
    2. 



## Lesson Learning Objectives


### Learning Objectives
After following this lesson, learners will be able to:

we make all these objectives measureable with hands-on exercises during workshop. 
 
* Learn how to read specific geophysics data formats (SEG-Y data).this is the first step, therefore, we definitely reach this during the workshop. **verbaction/specific/time-bound/measurable/attainable**
* Basic visualiztion (Matplotlib) and the interpretation of time, depth, and contrast of raw SEG-Y data.**verbaction/specific/time-bound/attainable**
* Understand and apply pre-processing filters (mean, median, automatic gain control) in the **time domain**, including fundamental theory for the aformetnioned filters.**verbaction/specific/time-bound/measurable/attainable**
* Understand and apply pre-processing filters (band-pass, notch) in the **frequency domain**, including fundamental theory for the aformetnioned filters.**verbaction/specific/time-bound/measurable/attainable** Interpret processed images through simple filters.**verbaction/time-bound/measurable**
* Explore advanced filtering (deconvolution, migration) techniques and their applications.
* Group project on exploring to find other filters that are applicable to this type of images.**specific/attaible** 
* how to work with advanced Python libraries for reading and exporting data.
